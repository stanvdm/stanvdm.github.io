# Starfisk - What's new in .NET?
On the 29th of October a fellow student told me he was attending a lecture in a software development company near campus, called Starfisk. The talk would be about the history of .NET and what's been added in the newer versions. I thought this would be a fun extension to the .NET fundamentals course I completed the previous semester, so I signed up.

The talk itself was given by a senior developer of the company (to the right of the banner in the picture above). He briefly went over the history of .NET, then explained the new features of the last couple of versions in great detail.

After the lecture we got to talk to some of the employees and other attendees, with a drink and some snacks.

Overall I would say this talk would be very interesting for those who are actively developing .NET applications, but wasn't really meant for someone like me, with limited experience in .NET. I understood everything he explained, but couldn't place the info well, since I hadn't come across the practical use cases for a lot of the mentioned solutions.
