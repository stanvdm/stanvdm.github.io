# The Best Hacker in Belgium
In november 2024 I went to Tech&Meet event with [Robbe Verwilghen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbe-verwilghen-ab66a1162/) as a speaker. He had just won the Hack the Government competition and was thus called the best hacker in Belgium.

He talked about how he got into hacking and his career so far. Including both his work as a hacker/bug bounty hunter and as a triage analyst. His explanations were accompanied by a lot of practical examples about bugs and vulnerabilities he found himself.

The talk was very down to earth, in the sense that Robbe gave practical examples and spoke as a hacker who hustled his way to success. This is unlike a lot of other talks I went to, i.e. the guest lectures from the Trending Topics course and a lecture about quantum computing in semester 4. Most of these lectures were given like a sales pitch. Explaining a topic, but also selling that topic or something related to it. I did not have this feeling with Robbe.

During the entire talk he would give tips on how we in the audience could walk a similar career path as he did. Which was very inspiring. I recommend anyone who is interested in pentesting to attend one of his talks.
