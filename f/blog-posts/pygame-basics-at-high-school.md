# PyGame and Python Basics
As a pr event, fellow student [Bram Lahousse](https://lahoussebram.github.io/) and I decided to give a lecture about the basics of PyGame and Python at the high school we went to, [Sint-Jozefscollege Torhout](https://www.sintjozefscollegetorhout.be/). We met our old math and Windows Server teachers, and were allowed to teach the final year studens in the same course we attended. This used to be called Informatica Beheer.

## Idea and preparations
To find an idea for the subject of the lecture, Bram and I looked back to what subjects and lectures we did and didn't enjoy back in high school. We wanted a very practical lecture where the students could code along and we wanted a subject that would be enticing to a large portion of the audience. So we decided to code a simple game, step by step, allowing the students to code along.

The high school teacher told us we had to assume the students didn't know any Python. So the first part of the lecture had to be a Python basics course. Bram handled this part.

I was tasked with coding a simple game. I decided to prepare two games:

### 1. Brick Breaker

A simple 2D game where a ball bounces off the a player conrolled paddle and breaks bricks. The goal is to break all the bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle.

### 2. Platformer
Github link: [https://github.com/stanvdm/platformer-st-rembert](https://github.com/stanvdm/platformer-st-rembert)

A simple platformer where the player can move around in a 2D world. The idea was to create a foundation which the students can expand with their own ideas, assets, etc.

The idea was initially to have the students vote, but after talking to Bram, we decided to use Brick Breaker, since the Platformer game was too complicated for the small time slot.

## Giving the lecture
We were given 2 lecture hours to give our lecture, meaning we had an hour and forty minutes. We first helped the students install python and the needed package, PyGame. Then Bram explained all the needed Python concepts using practical examples and references to Java, which the students were familiar with. After about 30 minutes it was my turn.

I started by showing the students the git repository and a demo of the game. Giving them the repository meant they could peek at the "solution" whenever they couldn't follow my explanation.

The live coding went pretty smoothly. Some bugs appeared, but I could resolve them by peeking at the solution. Most of the students could follow along and Bram could help those who couldn't. After the Brick Braker game was working, I showed the Platformer game and gave them the link to this repository as well.

We then answered some questions about courses, coding, Linux, etc. both from students and the teacher. The remaining time was spent answering these questions and helping some students to further develop their game.
