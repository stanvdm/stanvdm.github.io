# Help page - Portfolio Stan Vandamme
As a portfolio website I recreated the VIM text editor from scratch using only vanilla JS, html and css. All navigation is done with the keyboard (I added some mouse functionality for non vim users).

All articles are written in markdown and stored on git in the `/f/` directory. This directory is automatically indexed and presented in the form of a file explorer (netrw clone). Press `x` on any `.md` file to show it in a readable format. Press enter on a directory or file to open it (in raw text format).

The folder structure is as follows:
- **blog-posts** - directory containing various blog posts
- **about-me.md** - an about me document
- **help.md** - this document
- **the-making-of.md** - an explanation of how this site was made and its feature set

This help menu can be opened again any time by pressing `F1` or by opening the `help.md` file.

## Navigating the site
**If you already know vim**, then all you need to know is that `<ctrl>` has been replaced by `<alt>` since a lot of browser shortcuts use `<ctrl>` (e.g. `<ctrl> + w + j` becomes `<alt> + w + j`).

**If you don't know vim**, then read the short introduction below:
